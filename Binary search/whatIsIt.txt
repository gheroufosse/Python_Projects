What is binary search ?


- Divide and conquer algo : search in an ordered list fast than just scanning every single element

Divide and conquer :
-> Look for a certain element in a list.
-> We start at the middle, is the looked-for element it? If not, Is the looked-for element smaller or greater ?
-> We can disregard the right part of the list if it is the list. We can reiterate until we found the element.

Binary search is faster than naive search



In summary:

For a single search or smaller datasets, linear search on an unsorted list might be faster
due to its linear time complexity O(n).
For larger datasets or scenarios where multiple searches are performed on the same data,
sorting the list (O(nlogn)) and then using binary search (O(logn)) would be more efficient
due to the faster search time for subsequent searches.
